     </center> 

     <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-doctypes/">  < !DOCTYPE html > </a>– This is the document type declaration, not a tag. It declares that the document is an HTML5 document.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-html-tag/"> < html > </html></a>– This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-head-tag/"> < head > </a> – The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren’t visible on the front end of a webpage. Typical elements inside the < head > include :<br></li>
            <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-title-tag/"> <  title > </a>: Defines the title displayed on the browser tab.
            <li><a  href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-meta-tag/">  < meta > </a> : Provides information like the character set or viewport settings. 
            <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-link-tag/"> < link > </a> : Links external stylesheets or resources.
            <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-style-tag/"> < style > </style></a> : Embeds internal CSS styles.
            <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-script-tag/"> < script > </script></a> : Embeds JavaScript for functionality.
            </ul>
    
    <ur>
        <li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-title-tag/"> <  title  > </a> – The title is what is displayed on the top of your browser when you visit a website and contains the title of the webpage that you are viewing.</li> 
        <li> <b> < h2 > </h2> </b>   – The < h2 > tag is a second-level heading tag.
        <li> <a  href ="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-p-tag/"> < P > </a>   – The < p > tag represents a paragraph of text.</p></li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-body-tag/"> < body > </a> – The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.</li>  <br>
        An HTML document can be created using an <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-editors/"> HTML text editor </a>. Save the text file using the “.html” or “.htm” extension. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.</li> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>
        <b>Note</b>: Basic/built-in text editors are <b> Notepad (Windows)</b> and <b>TextEdit (MacOS).</b> Other advanced text editors include <b>Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, Froala,</b> etc.
        </em>
        <H1>Web Browsers</H1>
        Unlike other programming languages, HTML does not show output on the compiler. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-browser-a-complete-overview/"> Web browsers </a>show the results of an HTML code.</li> <br>
It reads HTML files and determines how to show content with the help of HTML tags. Any web browser <b>(Google, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc)</b> can be used to open a .<b> HTML file </b> and view the results. <br>
